# regsearch

(A work in progress)

This is a web app that will serves as a search engine for interpretive letters and opinions issued by the three federal banking regulators. 
I will be hosting it on AWS.

The project has helped me get some experience on a few things:

-AWS
-Nginx / uWSGI / Django
-web scraping the letters, including w/ Selenium
-implementing a search engine, which requires some light NLP preprocessing and mastery of TF-IDF indexing
